ESP32-S3 Square Display

The hardware used:
ESP32-S3 4inch Display Development Board, 480×480, 32-Bit LX7 Dual-Core Processor, Up To 240MHz Frequency, Supports WiFi & Bluetooth, With Onboard Antenna, ESP32 With Display https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-lcd-4.htm

This folder contains files and documentation for building the ESP32-S3 based square display.

Contents:
- PlatformIO project sources (refer to root `src/`)

Build and upload instructions:
1. Install PlatformIO and required toolchains.
2. Open the project root and run `pio run` then `pio run --target upload`.

See the main project root for full source code and assets.

Use an SD card for your icons and images. Store icons and PNGs (ideally monochrome images) so you can recolor them in the UI. Convert larger background images to `.bin` files. There is a conversion script in the project to help with this.

The display is 480x480, so make your background images this size.

Use 70x70 for icons.

I used Figma to create my images.

Save them on the SD card in a folder called `/assets`.

Video coming soon of the whole feature set and setup.

How to convert PNG backgrounds
------------------------------

This project uses raw RGB565 `.bin` background files on the SD card. The workflow we used is:

- Convert `*.png` to RGB565 `.bin` using `convert_png_to_rgb565.py` (or run `batch_convert.sh` which calls it for the assets).
- Copy the produced `.bin` files to the SD card `assets/` folder on the display.

Example (from project root):

```bash
# convert a single PNG to a .bin
python3 convert_png_to_rgb565.py assets/Rev_Counter.png assets/Rev_Counter.bin

# or run the batch helper (installs Pillow if needed)
./batch_convert.sh
```
